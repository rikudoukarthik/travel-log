title: "Karthik's Trip Planning Notebook"
---

Over the years, I have ended up making planning and/or itinerary documents for my trips, but these have all been ad-hoc documents stored in idiosyncratic locations like my Obsidian notes or GDocs shared with trip members. I figured there is utility in bringing them all together into a single place, especially considering I often end up making budget breakdowns or even detailed notes on difficult bird species IDs (when travelling in novel regions).

So, here is my notebook of travel logs. Eventually, I hope to come up with a name for it that's more clever and wieldy.
